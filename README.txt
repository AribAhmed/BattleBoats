Both of our Repo's should contain the final version of the project

I did:

- Agent.c
- Negotiation.c
- FieldTest.c
- MessageTest.c

Battleboats Overview:

Battleboats has four files. Negotiation decides who goes first and such. Field is placing boats on a field. Message accounts
for sending two players messages of attacks and challenges, etc. Agent runs the whole thing and sends it between everything. 

Negotiation

- Pretty straight forward
- Was the easiest part of the lab

Agent

- Holy fuck this took me forever. I am not sure if it is fully functional. It works somewhat and I hope its good enough for a B. 


Testing strategies that I found effective was to include all the .o files that worked except the one I wanted to test. It helped us find what
ever the problem was one at a time.  

I learned a lot in this lab. Negotiation Hashing was interesting to learn. I also did not know the difficulty to create a software version of this
game was. Im surprised a lot of games have minigames of this such as The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. 

I did not like anything from this lab. Absolutely nothing.
